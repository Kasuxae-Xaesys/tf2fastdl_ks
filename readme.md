# Team Fortress 2 FastDL For Kasuxae's Server
My TF2 Server file downloads using a github respository as a "FASTDL" "server".

# Why Did I Do It Like This
This little project started as a search for a way to get my own TF2 server hosted on my machine for me and my friends without having to worry about paying a service to host one for me.

It then turned into a rabbit hole of trying to find the easiest and most cost effective way for me to have custom maps and such get sent to clients that join without having to pay a webserver to host the files.

# Notes And Thoughts
If I suddenly had a penny every time I had run into poor people problems, I would be set for life.

Having to scour the internet in search of information on the most cost effective way to do somthing is hard considering almost everyone wants to get richer.

I just do my own thing with little regard of the consequences when I feel like I can get away with it.

Honestly I am unsure if this is even allowed on github because I can not find a concrete answer either in the terms of service or online, However if somehow this IS allowed on github, then GREAT!

# How To Do It
I simply followed [the guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcismZ0uZ1A) by the lovely "Cyanide/Sour Dani" on youtube, However I may add a refined text based guide here if I somehow got requested to do so by enough people.

# Finding My Server
My server uses the steam networking startup command as a security measure as well as a greifing deterrent.

Steam networking is good at what it does, But because of the way it works, It causes users to be unable to favorite the server. There is a way to [fix/stop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1960312187) steam networking from preventing favoriting the server however.

To find my server, you may either need to install a client-side mod to allow you to search for server's by name, or know at least one of the server's unique tags and enter said tag into the tag search bar.

My server is nammed "Kasuxae's Generic Server" and the most unique tag on the server is "advancedbots".
